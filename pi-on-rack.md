#### Just like the name, this is a RaspberryPi rackmount. 
### This project has not been tested! Use at your own risk! 
[Github Link](https://github.com/Colgrave34/pi-on-rack){: .btn .btn-blue } \
3D file [Here](https://github.com/Colgrave34/pi-on-rack/blob/main/left-mount/left-single/left-single.stl) \
I used Blender for this project. And used [Boolean](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/generate/booleans.html) to use out the holes. \
\
I have plans for dual mount, right-mount and full 1U mount, please look forward to it! \
