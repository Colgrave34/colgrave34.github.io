#### Just like the name, this is a Raspberry Pi rackmount. 
### This project has not been tested! Use at your own risk! 
This project is specifically built for Raspberry Pi 4 with official PoE HAT. No guarantee it will work for Raspberry Pi 3b+ or other HATs. \
I use m2.5 hex standoffs (m2.5*4+4)\

\
I used Blender for this project. And used [Boolean](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/generate/booleans.html) to cut out the holes. \
\
I have plans for dual mount, right-mount and full 1U mount, please look forward to it! \
